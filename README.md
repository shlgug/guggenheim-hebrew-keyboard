# Guggenheim Hebrew Keyboard Layout

A Dvorak-like Hebrew keyboard layout which emulates the principles and design of the English [Dvorak keyboard layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout).  This offers the many benifits of the keyboard layout and makes it easier to learn and use for someone who already knows the Dvorak keyboard layout.

The puncuation characters are in the same places as on the Dvorak keyboard.  The vowel associated / gutteral / tense letters are on the left side of the keyboard, similiar to the Dvorak keyboard.  The most common letters are in the home row, followed by the top row.

The Mac version was created using Ukelele.
